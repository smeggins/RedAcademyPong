# Pong Game Starter

A starter project for a basic pong game using SVGs.

## Setup

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed first.

**Install dependencies:**

`$ npm install`

**Run locally with the Parcel dev server:**

`$ npm start`

Once you run the start command you can access your project at http://localhost:3000.

Read more about the [Parcel web application bundler here](https://parceljs.org/).

## Deploy

The deployment workflow for this project will be a bit different from what you've used when deploying simple static websites.

To deploy your finished Pong project as a GitHub page, you must first **update the `predeploy` script in the `package.json` file with the name of your repo.**

For example, if your repo URL is:

https://github.com/bob/pong-project

Update the `predeploy` script as follows:

```json
"predeploy": "rm -rf dist && parcel build index.html --public-url /pong-project",
```

Once you have done this, you can run:

`$ npm run deploy`

Now check out your deployed site ðŸ™‚


# VERSION HISTORY

## Beta 1.16

    Restart function in pause menu is now fully functional!

## Beta 1.15

    Made both paddles able to move smoothly and independantly of each other. 
        -took a while, spent a long time trying to get keypress to work over seperate key up and down checks but at the end of the day this works... 

## Beta 1.14

    pressing pause on my pausemenu.
        -had to remove my menu nav from my render loop after it caused too much instability. still trying to find a way to update the (paused = ) in my menunav so it only works when the game is paused..
        -haven't been able to figure out how to call the reset function in my Game class in a method within my menu class.. basically to reset the game when the option is selected in the menu  

## Beta 1.13

    Finally found a solution to the pause menu issue. But it seems to have significant latency lag, may need to be more specific when calling event.

## Beta 1.12

    added code to track menu selection but having a hard time getting an updated value from my game class to apply to my pause class

## Beta 1.1
    
    Adds a pause menu an options to select.
    need to add pause menu functionality

## Beta 1.0

        Main game pivot:
            Note:
                
                **this is VERY unlikley to be completed over the long weekend, the focus will be on a polished multiplayer experience first as is required by the project outline**

                *Time permitting i'd like the game to be a single player pong clone with an ai paddle on the other side with breakable blocks in-between...
                *you would play up-down during regular play and left right during multiplayer...
                * there would be certain blocks that have items in them and certain 'glowing' blocks that would gradually dim. if you break the block while its glowing you get a powerful power up. if the block goes out it becomes a single hit block...
                *with each level more blocks would stand between you and the enemy paddle and some blocks would take more hits to break...
                *some blocks are unbreakable and are used to create special level designs.
                *there should be a currency from breaking gold blocks that you can use in a store menu to buy upgrades for your paddle...
                *when the ball hits your area you lose your upgrades, otherwise you keep them from level to level...



            *add AI option / difficulties
            *add complex vector calculations to allow for "aiming" based on where the ball hits your paddle.
                -ideas on this would be to set a vy instead of randomizing it and increasing (or decreasing) that vy by 1 the further left or right you are from center on the paddle
            *add block-break function
                -blocks containing items
                -blocks that take more than 1 hit
                -unbreakable blocks
                -glowing 'super' blocks

            *add store
            *add abilities
            *add levels
            *add save feature (either to record progress of a game or to save high score)

        *The loop code worked in my "canvas" pong project.... dt only matters for moving objects so that part of the code shouldn't matter...
